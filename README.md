# kearney-thesis-2023
A repository containing all of my code, tables, and other files used in the creation of my Honors Thesis on a Player-Focused ELO Rating.

ThesisWork.rmd is the main file containing the ELO algorithim and a massive for loop to iterate through one NCAA season. Due to the file being for internal use only, the formatting/commenting/functions/good code standards are not ideal. Will be improving when I get the time.

playerFocus.rmd is the file used to get filtered player data, as well as contain a backup of my main thesis code just in case.

cleanThesisData is the RData file that contains all of my output from Day 1 of this project, as it has multiple iterations of full ELO dataframes and other goodies.
